# Uses "Alt" button to the left of spacebar as "Cmd" key
#
# Note:
#   This 'trick' generally requires that the press+release of the Meta
#   key will do nothing. On my system, I had to disable the "overlay-key"
#   in mutter to make it inert:
#     - `gsettings set org.gnome.mutter overlay-key ''`
