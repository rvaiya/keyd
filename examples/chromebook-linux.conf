# NOTE: to use this, rename this file to default.conf or `your-chomebook-keyboard-name`.conf and put in /etc/keyd/

# This is an chromebook like configuration, this remaps function keys 1 through 10 to fall in line with the chromeos remapping
# while still allowing for full access to standard linux functions that rely on those function keys, such as TTY access or
# terminal programs

# Using this on an chromebook that has been modified to run linux will make the function keys work as designed originally 
# for the most part, F4 and F5 are mapped differently due to limitations of `keyd` and lack of functional support for their features
# in most linux desktop environments

# pressing meta+Fn will trigger that FN key
# pressing ctrl+alt+Fn will trigger that key stroke
